# Remittances of Goods and Services as a Sustainability Finance Strategy: Enabling the Diaspora to Support Friends and Family in Developing Countries in Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

<p align="justify">A look into the inflow and outflow of remittances to understand the global remittance landscape in order to highlight the ideal geographies for remittance-based aid development initiatives.

The proposed work is an e-commerce platform that would enable senders of remittances to purchase sustainable energy products of their choice for family members in their country of origin. Sustainable energy products can include: solar panels, solar water pumps, solar power generators, solar water heaters,wind power equipment, bioenergy heating stove, hydro energy electric lamp, clean cooking fuels/devices, etc.

The inputs for this work include an estimated budget, staff salaries for both administrative and technical teams, and an enabling regulatory environment. There are two main activities for this project: (1) remitters purchasing items on an e-commerce platform and (2) the procurement of green products and services. The main output of this project is that remittance-receivers gain access to green energy products and services and the outcome is increased utilization of green energy products in the Global South. </p>

This work will directly or indirectly address the following SDGs:
1. Good health and wellbeing
2. Affordable and clean energy
3. Sustainable cities and communities 
4. Responsible consumption and production
5. Climate action
