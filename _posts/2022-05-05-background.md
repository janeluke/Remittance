**Background**

<p align="justify">We set out to understand the global remittance and green energy environments in order to determine the feasibility of remittance-based aid in achieving the SDGs. Research has been conducted with the goal of assessing the feasibility of an in-kind, e-procurement remittance system (recipients receive green goods and services instead of money).</p>


**Why is this important?**

<p align="justify">For this study, we understood remittances to be cross-border, voluntary monetary and non-monetary (in-kind) transfers made by migrants and diaspora members, individually or collectively, to people or communities in their home countries. Remittances have become an increasingly important source of development finance for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), as remittance flows have surpassed official development assistance (ODA) and are more consistent than other sources, such as foreign direct investment (FDI) and private debt and investment equity. According to Figure 1, remittances are three times that of ODA, and have even surpassed FDI in recent years.</p>

Table 1 below shows a quantitative and comparative analysis of global remittance inflows and outflows, utilizing data from the World Bank Group. The top 10 overall sending and receiving countries are presented, along with continental rankings, regional rankings (based on the UNICEF regional classification scheme), and receiving countries in which remittances comprise a large portion of their GDP.

**Minimize Harm Ethics**

<p align="justify">It is also very important that we should understand the harm minimization logic during the projects. All programming should be rooted in Minimize Harm ethics. It’s impossible to do no harm or zero harm when we implement projects, but we can try our best to minimize harm. It will be crucial to work with local utility providers, delivery and installation companies, etc. We don’t want to disrupt local supply chains or stir up conflict when we can avoid it.</p>
