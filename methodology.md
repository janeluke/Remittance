To further assess global remittance flows, we broke down the developing world into three broad geographic categories and highlighted the countries receiving the highest value of remittances within each key geography. Using this breakdown, we aimed to understand the magnitude of remittance flows to the region (including GDP), common ways of remitting, and to build a broad profile of the receivers and uses.
1. Asia, with a focus on China and the Philippines
2. Africa, with a focus on Egypt and Nigeria
3. Latin America and the Caribbean, with a focus on Mexico

## Asia ## 

The Asian countries receiving the largest remittance inflows overall (1980-2021e) are India ($1.216 trillion), China ($937 billion), and Philippines ($540 billion). Other important countries are South Korea($181 billion), and Indonesia ($150 billion). Remittances in Asia are  mainly cash transfers, rather than in-kind remittances. The  most common ways of sending remittances in Asia include Western Union, Remitly, WorldRemit, Transferwise, and Bank of China & Alipay for China[^1].

For most countries in Asia, we can tell that remittances do not contribute a significant portion to their GDP. Only 8 countries in Asia experience remittances comprising more than 10% of their GDP. These countries are Lebanon (34.8%), Kyrgyz Republic (30.1%), Tajikistan (27.8%), and Nepal (24.8%). We also want to mention that, compared to East Asian countries (China: 0.13%, Japan: 0.1%, South Korea: 0.45%), South and Southeast Asian countries (Philippines: 9.7%, India: 3.1%, Vietnam: 6.3%) rely more on remittances to contribute to GDP, because East Asian countries have more developed industries that can support economic growth than Southeast Asian and South Asian countries.

For the Philippines, less than 10% of lower income households receive remittances. This number increases consistently through the higher income quintiles[^2], exceeding 35% for the fifth quintile. We also found that higher socioeconomic status (SES) peoples have greater access to international remittances in other countries (China, South Korea, etc.). In terms of consumption patterns in Asia, households spend a large portion of remittances on daily consumption and basic or “public sector” expenditures, including house-building, festivals, primary education (providing school fees for migrant family members), and basic health care. Chinese people save most of their remittances, as there is a strong culture of saving in China.

## Africa ##

The African countries receiving the largest remittance inflows overall (1980-2021e) are Egypt ($381 billion), Nigeria ($347 billion), Morocco ($163 billion), Tunisia ($49 billion), and Ghana ($37 billion). It is clear that Egypt and Nigeria are receiving the greatest amount of remittances–soaring magnitudes above other countries in the African top 10. Egypt and Nigeria are also the top 2 richest African countries due to their rapidly growing economies, the rise in oil prices benefitting oil-producing countries worldwide, and perhaps partially due to the massive amount of remittance inflows they receive. 

For these two countries, remittances do not comprise a significant portion of their GDP (8.4% and 3.7% respectively), as they are able to benefit from other robust industries such as petroleum (imports and exports), agricultural production, tourism, and more. This is in stark contrast to countries in which remittances make up a large portion of their GDP, including South Sudan (38%), Gambia (34%), Somalia (32%), and Lesotho (24%). These nations seem to overly rely on remittance inflows due to ongoing conflict stifling economic growth in the case of South Sudan and Somalia, an underdeveloped economy in the Gambia, and proximity to a much more robust economy for Lesotho.

The most common ways to send remittances in Africa are through Western Union and Moneygram–which take up 20% of the market[^3]–in addition to Transferwise and Mpesa. Another common method is Hawala: person-to-person delivery that bypasses economic sanctions, transfer costs, and formal ID requirements. The Hawala system refers to an informal channel for transferring funds from one location to another through service providers—known as hawaladars—regardless of the nature of the transaction and the countries involved. While hawala transactions are mostly initiated by migrant workers living in developed countries, the hawala system can also be used to send funds from developing countries abroad[^4]. This system is helpful for those in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) because money transfers cost more than the global average here. In SSA, transfers incurred an average of 8.9% in fees in 2019, compared to the global average of 6.8%. Experts advise that a more sustainable solution to bringing the benefits of low-cost, secure, and efficient digital remittances to sub-Saharan Africa involves establishing nationally recognized digital identity systems[^5]. 

According to IFAD, one in five people in Africa send or receive international remittances (without considering domestic flows). The Nigerian diaspora is one of the largest African immigrant populations in the world, with a global population of 1.7 million in 2020. The diaspora mainly consists of semi-skilled, skilled and highly skilled professionals that are able to consistently send remittances back home. Most remittances received cover daily needs, with a portion (~25%) allocated for savings or investment[^6]. The World Bank reported that most of the funds are used for household consumption, while some are used for education, health and other human capital development. Another portion is invested in land, livestock or housing construction, however little is used for investments, such as savings or business, or to repay debt[^7].

## Latin America and the Caribbean ##

Latin America, particularly Central America and Mexico, was the only region in the world to see an increase in remittances in 2020 (1%). Central Americans and Mexicans receive remittances primarily from the United States, and almost all remittances are used to cover basic needs: food, health, and housing [^8]. The most common way of sending remittances in this geography is via bank transfers and money transfer services. Foreign exchanges like Western Union, MoneyGram, OFX, TransferWise, and Xoom are utilized. OFX is the cheapest money transfer method in Mexico, but is still overshadowed by the use of Western Union. There are also newer, more enterprising foreign exchange services like Stellar, a platform that enables people to create, send, and trade digital representations of all forms of money: dollars, pesos, bitcoin, etc. Stellar was designed so all the world’s financial systems can work together on a single network, though it is worth noting that given the delayed establishment of cryptocurrency laws, it may be used for illicit purposes.

Mexico has received 600 billion in remittances over the last ~20 years (1980-2021e). Mexico and Central America receive their remittances mainly from the U.S., while the rest of Latin America receives most remittances from Mexico, neighboring South American countries, and Spain. Countries in the region with the highest percentage of remittances accounting for GDP are Honduras (26.6%), El Salvador (26.2%), Jamaica (23.6%), Guatemala (18%), and Nicaragua (15.5%).
